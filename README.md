## Introduction

LeetCode is a platform for practicing coding skills and preparing for technical interviews. In this repository, you will find my solutions to a variety of problems, along with explanations and insights into my approach for each problem.

## Problem Categories

I have categorized the problems based on their types. Below are the categories included in this repository:

- **Arrays**
- **Strings**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Trees**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Backtracking**
- **Graphs**
- **Others**

## Solutions

Each problem is organized in its own folder, which includes:

- The problem description (usually linked to the LeetCode problem).
- My solution code (in Python, Java, C++, etc.).
- A brief explanation of the approach and thought process.

### Example Problem

#### [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

- **Category**: Arrays
- **Difficulty**: Easy

**Solution**: [two_sum.py](./arrays/two_sum.py)

**Explanation**:
The problem requires finding two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target. My approach involves using a hash map to store the indices of the numbers as I iterate through the array. This allows for a time complexity of O(n).
